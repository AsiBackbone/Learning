# Repository controls

This directory records the repository-specific desired state for GitHub-host
security controls that cannot be enforced by the documentation build or sample
test suite.

`main-branch-ruleset.json` is the canonical repository ruleset payload for the
`main` branch. Apply or audit it with:

```powershell
./scripts/Manage-RepositorySecurityControls.ps1
./scripts/Manage-RepositorySecurityControls.ps1 -Apply -WhatIf
./scripts/Manage-RepositorySecurityControls.ps1 -Apply
```

The script requires an authenticated `gh` session. Mutation requires repository
Administration permission.

## Selected posture

- Dependabot security updates: enabled;
- secret scanning: enabled;
- secret-scanning push protection: enabled and mandatory;
- non-provider secret patterns: enabled when GitHub exposes the feature for this
  repository/plan;
- secret validity checks: enabled when GitHub exposes the feature for this
  repository/plan;
- main changes: pull request required;
- merge method: squash only;
- linear history: required;
- force pushes and deletion: blocked;
- stale approvals: dismissed on new reviewable pushes;
- four existing documentation/sample/link/CodeQL GitHub Actions checks: required
  and strict;
- review-thread resolution: required;
- required approvals / Code Owner approval / last-push approval: disabled while
  the repository has only one active maintainer;
- required signed commits: deferred until normal local and automation commits are
  consistently signed and can pass GitHub's PR signature evaluation without
  turning routine merges into bypasses;
- bypass: only GitHub user `@cdcavell` (user id `28095137`), and only through a
  pull request.

The explicit user bypass is intentionally narrower than a repository-role or
organization-administrator exemption. `pull_request` bypass mode preserves the
PR and ruleset-bypass audit trail and does not grant an emergency direct-push
path to `main`.

## Required checks captured by the manifest

The current protected `main` branch requires these GitHub Actions checks, and the
ruleset deliberately carries the same set forward:

- `Build DocFX documentation`
- `Validate documentation links`
- `Restore, build, and test samples`
- `Analyze C# with CodeQL`

The GitHub Actions integration id currently associated with those checks is
`15368`. If a check is renamed, added, removed, or moves to a different trusted
integration, update the manifest in the same PR as the workflow/protection
change.

## Review rule changes like code

Changing this manifest changes the expected repository trust boundary. Review
the diff for bypass actors, target refs, required checks, merge methods, and PR
requirements before applying it. Do not use `-Apply` merely to overwrite an
unexpected live configuration without first determining why it drifted.

The rationale, optional-feature decision, signed-commit deferral, and emergency
bypass procedure are documented in
`docs/security/repository-host-security-controls.md`.
